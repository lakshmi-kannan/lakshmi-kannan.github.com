## [{{page.title}}][1]

My name is Tomaz Muraus and I am a software engineer from Slovenia currently
located in San Francisco.

In my free time I like to mess with the computers, develop and participate in the
open-source project.

I am also a project-chair and committer at the [Apache Libcloud][2] project.
Libcloud is a Python library which allows users to work with many different
cloud providers using a single and unified interface.

My primary and favorite programming language of choice is Python, but if necessary I can
also work with JavaScript, Java, C++, TCL and probably most of the other
languages you can think of.

Fields of my interests include distributed systems, cloud computing, monitoring,
configuration management, device hacking (Android phone and tablets) and open
source projects and communities.

I work for [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com) where I'm currently help
building and maintaining [next generation monitoring system][3].

If you want to get in touch, you can email me at **lakshmi at lakshmikannan dot me**
