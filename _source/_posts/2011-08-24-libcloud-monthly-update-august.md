## [{{page.title}}][1]

As you might have noticed, I didn't write a monthly update post in the last two
months. The reason for that is that I have been busy with work and finishing my
thesis for a bachelor degree.

In this post I will try to sum up what has happened during this time and what
is currently going on.

### What has happened in the past two months

* Libcloud 0.5.2 has been released.

  This is a primary a bug-fix release, but it also includes two new compute
  drivers for *serverlove.com* and *skalicloud.com*. Full changelog and release
  announcement can be found [here][2].

* EuroPython 2011 sprint was a success.

  At a peek time we had a total of 6 sprinters :) A lot of stuff which has been
  accomplished at the sprint has been integrated into 0.5.2 release. You can also
  find slides and recording of my Libcloud talk on [EuroPython 2011 website][5].

* I have finally met another Libcloud developer in real-life.

  This time I have met
  [Roman a.k.a. mirrorbox][4] in San Francisco. Most of our conversation was not Libcloud
  related, but we managed to talk a bit about the Libcloud future
  and topics such as DNS support, problems with our current blocking-model and
  asynchronous API's and possible support for event-based libraries such as Twisted
  and gevent.

### What is currently going on

* Me and <strike>Paul Querna</strike> (Paul Querna can't make it since he is
  away on 7th) will be guests on the [FLOSS weekly][3]
  podcast so don't forget to tune-in on **September 7, 2011 at 09:30 AM US Pacific Time**. Show is
  streamed live, but as always recording will also be available a day or two
  later.
