<p>Welcome to Libcloud April 2012 update post. Sorry for skipping a couple of months, but I have been pretty busy again. In any case, here is a short but sweet April update.</p>

<li>I have attended <a href='https://us.pycon.org/2012/'>PyCon US 2012</a> in Santa Clara in March. As always, it was a lot of fun talking with old and meeting new friends. This year we didn&#8217;t hold a Libcloud development sprint, but I still managed to talk with some Libcloud users and prompted Libcloud at the AWS open space session.</li>

<li>Libcloud has applied to <a href='http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012'>Google Summer of Code 2012</a> under Apache organization. We have received 1 slot. Student Ilgiz Islamgulov will be working on the <a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-159'>Libcloud REST interface</a> this summer.</li>

<li>We are currently moving towards 1.0 release which means mostly polishing the code, fixing bugs and avoiding big and API breaking changes. A lot of code, especially compute API has already been battle tested, but there are still some parts which I want to see improved (deployment functionality for example) before releasing 1.0.</li>

<p>Past few months have been pretty busy here and you may have noticed that I didn&#8217;t post a monthly update post in the last two months. This doesn&#8217;t mean nothing has been going on though! In fact, quite the contrary. Last few months have been very busy and we have shipped two new releases and a voting thread for a new 0.7.1 release was just started a few days ago. More about that bellow.</p>

<ul>
<li>A lot of things!</li>

<li>This weekend I have just finished adding support for Python 3 to Libcloud. Now we have a single code base which supports both, Python 2 and 3 and as far as I know we are the first Python cloud library which does that. I hope other projects will follow. If you are interested in more details you can read my post titled <a href='/2011/12/03/lessons-learned-while-porting-libcloud-to-python-3.html'>Lessons learned while porting Libcloud to Python 3</a> where I have described some of the issues which I have encountered while porting the library. Armin has recently also wrote a good blog post about Python 3 which you should read - <a href='http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/12/7/thoughts-on-python3/'>Thoughts on Python 3</a>.</li>

<li>I am moving to San Francisco where I will work full time for Rackspace. I will try to organize a Bay Area Libcloud meet-up in the upcoming weeks (hey, free pizza and beer!). I will post more info on the website and mailing list when all the details are fleshed out.</li>

        <h2 id='lessons_learned_while_porting_libcloud_to_python_3'><a href='/2011/12/03/lessons-learned-while-porting-libcloud-to-python-3.html'>Lessons learned while porting Libcloud to Python 3</a></h2>

<p>Yesterday after seeing and being inspired by the <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3305021'>Django Python 3 port</a> news, I have decided it&#8217;s finally time to port <a href='http://libcloud.apache.org/'>Libcloud</a> to Python 3. There have already been some talks about doing that in the past, but nobody actually managed to make a lot of progress.</p>

<p>In general, our goal is pretty similar to the Django one - have a single code base which works with Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 / PyPy and Python 3.</p>

<p>Alternative approach to having a single code base is using a tool like <a href='http://docs.python.org/library/2to3.html'>2to3</a> to automatically convert 2.x version to the 3.x one or having multiple code bases / branches - one for 2.x and one for 3.x.</p>

<p>Early on when we talked about porting to Python 3, we have decided that we will go with a &#8220;single code base&#8221; approach. This approach allows us to keep a fast development pace and it&#8217;s also more friendlier for our users.</p>

<p>In this post I will describe some of the issues which I have encountered while porting the library and how I have solved them.</p>

<h2 id='1_handling_renamed_libraries_and_moved_functionality'>1. Handling renamed libraries and moved functionality</h2>

<h3 id='httplib'>httplib</h3>

<p>In Python 3 <code>httplib</code> has been renamed to <code>http.client</code>. To solve this problem, I have used an aliased import - <code>import http.client as httplib</code>.</p>

<h3 id='urllib__urllib2'>urllib &amp; urllib2</h3>

<p>All of the functionality from <code>urllib2</code> has been merged to <code>urllib</code>. This problem can also be easily solved using an aliased import - <code>import urllib as urllib2</code>.</p>

<h3 id='urlparse'>urlparse</h3>

<p>Functionality from <code>urlparse</code> has been moved to <code>urllib.parse</code>. We only use two functions from this module (quote and urlencode) so simple aliased import did the trick:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='python'><span class='kn'>from</span> <span class='nn'>urllib.parse</span> <span class='kn'>import</span> <span class='n'>quote</span> <span class='k'>as</span> <span class='n'>urlquote</span>
<span class='kn'>from</span> <span class='nn'>urllib.parse</span> <span class='kn'>import</span> <span class='n'>urlencode</span> <span class='k'>as</span> <span class='n'>urlencode</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id='xmlrpclib'>xmlrpclib</h3>

<p><code>xmlrpclib</code> has been moved to <code>xmlrpc.client</code>. Simple aliased import also solved this problem - <code>import xmlrpc.client as xmlrpclib</code>.</p>

<h3 id='stringio'>StringIO</h3>

<p><code>StringIO</code> has also been moved. <code>from io import StringIO</code> did the trick.</p>

<h2 id='2__type_and_filelike_objects'>2. <code>file</code> type and file-like objects</h2>

<p><code>file</code> type has been removed in Python 3. To resolve this problem, I have used code similar to the one bellow in the places where we use <code>file</code> type.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='python'><span class='k'>if</span> <span class='n'>PY3</span><span class='p'>:</span>
    <span class='kn'>from</span> <span class='nn'>io</span> <span class='kn'>import</span> <span class='n'>FileIO</span> <span class='k'>as</span> <span class='nb'>file</span>

<span class='k'>class</span> <span class='nc'>MyFileLikeObject</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nb'>file</span><span class='p'>):</span>
    <span class='o'>...</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id='3_generators_and__method'>3. Generators and <code>.next()</code> method.</h2>

<p>For consistency with other magic methods, <code>next</code> method in Python 3 has been renamed to <code>__next__</code>. To make it work with all the versions, I have used built-in <code>next</code> function in Python &gt;= 3 and object <code>.next()</code> method in older versions.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='python'><span class='k'>if</span> <span class='n'>sys</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>version_info</span> <span class='o'>&gt;=</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>3</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='mi'>0</span><span class='p'>):</span>
    <span class='nb'>next</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>__builtins__</span><span class='p'>[</span><span class='s'>&#39;next&#39;</span><span class='p'>]</span>
<span class='k'>else</span><span class='p'>:</span>
    <span class='k'>def</span> <span class='nf'>next</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='n'>i</span><span class='p'>):</span>
        <span class='k'>return</span> <span class='n'>i</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>next</span><span class='p'>()</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id='4_exception_handling'>4. Exception handling</h2>

<p>Sadly, there is no unified way to handle exceptions and extract the exception object in Python 2.5 and Python 3.x. This means I needed to use a hacky <code>sys.exc_info()[1]</code> approach to extract the raised exception</p>

<p>Old code:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='python'><span class='k'>try</span><span class='p'>:</span>
    <span class='n'>foo</span>
<span class='k'>except</span> <span class='ne'>Exception</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='n'>e</span><span class='p'>:</span>
    <span class='k'>print</span> <span class='n'>e</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>New code:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='python'><span class='k'>try</span><span class='p'>:</span>
    <span class='n'>foo</span>
<span class='k'>except</span> <span class='ne'>Exception</span><span class='p'>:</span>
    <span class='n'>e</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>sys</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>exc_info</span><span class='p'>()[</span><span class='mi'>1</span><span class='p'>]</span>
    <span class='k'>print</span> <span class='n'>e</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>One of the PyPy developers has <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/mxufx/django_python_3_port_all_tests_now_pass_on_272/'>posted on reddit</a> that this approach is very slow in PyPy. Luckily, besides the tests, there aren&#8217;t many places in our code where we need access to the exception object so this should be a good compromise for now.</p>

<h2 id='5_filter_map_dictkeys'>5. filter, map, dict.keys()</h2>

<p>In Python 2 those functions return a <code>list</code>, but in Python 3 they return a special object. Compatibility can be preserved by casting a result from this function to a list - e.g. <code>list(filter(lamba x: x.name == &#39;test&#39;, nodes))</code>.</p>

<h2 id='6_iteritems_xrange'>6. iteritems, xrange</h2>

<p>In Python 3, <code>iteritems</code> method has been removed and functionality from <code>xrange</code> has been merged into <code>range</code>. I have simplify replaced <code>iteritems</code> with <code>items</code> and <code>xrange</code> with <code>range</code>. We never used <code>xrange</code> with a lot of values so storing a whole list in memory in Python 2.x shouldn&#8217;t be a huge deal.</p>

<h2 id='7__and_encoding'>7. <code>xml.etree.ElementTree.tostring</code> and encoding</h2>

<p>In Python 3 this method returns <a href='http://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/57e631f088d7/'>bytes by default</a>. To preserve the old behavior and get a string back, I have used a code similar to one bellow:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='python'><span class='k'>if</span> <span class='n'>PY3</span><span class='p'>:</span>
    <span class='n'>encoding</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='s'>&#39;unicode&#39;</span>
<span class='k'>else</span><span class='p'>:</span>
    <span class='n'>encoding</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='bp'>None</span>

<span class='n'>data</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>tostring</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='n'>root</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='n'>encoding</span><span class='o'>=</span><span class='n'>encoding</span><span class='p'>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id='8_encodehex'>8. encode(&#8216;hex&#8217;)</h2>

<p>We had multiple places in the code where we did something like this:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='python'><span class='n'>value</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>os</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>urandom</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>8</span><span class='p'>)</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>encode</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s'>&#39;hex&#39;</span><span class='p'>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Hex encoding has been removed from Python 3. I have preserved backward compatibility by using <code>binascii</code> module:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='python'><span class='n'>value</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>binascii</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>hexlify</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='n'>os</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>urandom</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>8</span><span class='p'>))</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id='9_octal_numbers'>9. Octal numbers</h2>

<p>In Python 3 there is a special backward-incompatible (and strange) syntax for octal numbers - e.g. <code>0o755</code>. We only use octal number in one place and this has been easily resolved by using <code>int</code> to convert a string to a number with base 8 - <code>int(&#39;755&#39;, 8)</code>.</p>

<p>Those are just some of the issues I have encountered during porting. If you want to view all of the issues and how I have resolved them, you can see a full diff <a href='https://github.com/apache/libcloud/compare/c995ea6b8b37d4bbec741a7d2d70b08da1c62f55...py3k'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m pretty satisfied with the outcome. I have managed to keep most of the Python 2 and Python 3 compatibility code in a single module (<code>libcloud.py3</code>) and it probably took me less then 5 hours to do the whole port including the research.</p>

        <p>First a short-introduction for people who aren&#8217;t familiar with Whiskey.</p>

<p><a href='https://github.com/cloudkick/whiskey'>Whiskey</a> is a powerful test runner for Node.js applications. It supports async testing, code coverage, scope leaks reporting, Makefile generation, test timing and lot more. Be sure to check out the <a href='https://github.com/cloudkick/whiskey'>github page</a> which lists all the features.</p>

<p>New version (0.6.0) which has been released today includes a process runner and a support for managing external test dependencies. Test dependency is any kind of process on which the (integration) tests depend on.</p>

<p>Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>database,</li>

<li>some kind of api server,</li>

<li>web server,</li>

<li>other external services</li>
</ul>

<p>Process runner is configured using a simple JSON configuration file. Most of the options have sane default values, which means if you don&#8217;t have any special requirements you can configure it very quickly.</p>

<p>Example configuration file which we use for our monitoring system integration test suite at Rackspace can be found <a href='https://gist.github.com/5953e55ced30ef8a9581'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Each process can also specify its dependencies in the <code>depends</code> option which allows Whiskey to start unrelated processes concurrently.</p>

<p>Before Whiskey process runner was available we have been using <a href='http://www.scons.org/'>scons</a> for managing and running all the test dependencies. Test dependencies related section in our <code>SConstruct</code> file was long and hard to maintain which means switching to Whiskey process runner was a nice improvement.</p>

<p>Process runner can be used by passing <code>--dependencies &lt;configuration_file_path.json&gt;</code> option to <code>whiskey</code> binary. By default all the dependencies specified in the configuration file are started, but there is also <code>--only-esential-dependencies</code> option available which will make Whiskey first inspect the test files and only start the processes which are required by the tests which will be ran.</p>

<p>Each test file can specify on which processes it depends by exporting <code>dependencies</code> attribute. This attribute must be an array and contain the names of the processes as defined in the configuration file.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions you can find me on #Node.js IRC channel on freenode (nick <code>Kami_</code>). If you find a bug or a problem you can also open an ticket on the project <a href='https://github.com/cloudkick/whiskey/issues'>issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Without further ado here is a Libcloud monthly update for September 2011.</p>

<h3 id='what_has_been_accomplished_in_the_past_month'>What has been accomplished in the past month</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I was a guest on FLOSS weekly (podcast about FOSS software) where I talked about Libcloud. You can find video and audio recording of the show on <a href='http://twit.tv/show/floss-weekly/181'>twit.tv</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>OpenStack and Rackspace drivers have received a lot of needed attention and refactoring. Rackspace driver now properly inherits from the OpenStack one instead of vice versa (thanks <a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=manganeez'>Mike</a>). This will make extending the Rackspace driver and developing other provider drivers which are based on OpenStack a lot easier. Rackspace drivers now also support authentication with Rackspace Auth 1.1.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Linode compute driver now supports new location in Japan.</p>

<p>Linode has recently <a href='http://blog.linode.com/2011/09/19/linode-cloud-asia-pacific/'>added a new location (Tokyo, Japan)</a> and this location is now also <a href='http://blog.linode.com/2011/09/19/linode-cloud-asia-pacific/'>supported in Libcloud</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>DNS API development has finally started.</p>

<p>Base API proposal can be found <a href='http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/libcloud-dev/201109.mbox/%3CCAJMHEmLfWki5awUqZL9ZNsrpJFkHNHAe00Vs5SeaJXkmWSxJ7g@mail.gmail.com%3E'>here</a>. I have also just finished a reference implementation and a first driver for the Linode DNS as a service. The driver can be found in <a href='https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/libcloud/trunk/libcloud/dns/drivers/linode.py?view=markup'>trunk</a>. Feedback is <a href='http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/libcloud-dev/201109.mbox/%3CCAJMHEmL7M12TG5eFz0HQ-kCuA3=ZnNkTt8_veoOFNfueaG9q2w@mail.gmail.com%3E'>welcome (and encouraged)</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='what_is_currently_going_on'>What is currently going on</h3>

<ul>
<li>Hacking on the DNS API continues. DNS API with at least two drivers is planned to be included in the next release (0.6.0) which should be out around November.</li>
</ul>

<p>See you next month!</p>
